## Installation

```bash
pip install nvdya-kit
```

## Quick Start

```python
# Import the library
from nvdya_kit import models, preprocessing, metrics

# Prepare your data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = preprocessing.train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# Create and train a model with GPU acceleration
model = models.RandomForest(n_estimators=100, gpu_enabled=True)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
predictions = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
accuracy = metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
print(f"Model accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```
